# Helping Hands

## What is Our Project About?

Suicide has been an intractable public health problem despite advances in the diagnosis and treatment of major mental disorders. Studies have shown that youth are likely to disclose suicidal thoughts and risk factors online and on social media. For example, a study examining emergency room assessments of suicidality found that adolescents were likely to report suicidal ideations not only verbally, but also via electronic means, which included posts on social networking sites, blog posts, instant messages, text messages, and emails.

Online expression of distress and suicidality may not be disclosed to physicians. It is unclear to what extent such online expressions are comparable to suicidal risk as elicited by physicians, and we were interested to lend out our Helping Hand to the youth and aid in recognizing the state of their mind. Here we develop a machine learning approach based on Reddit and Twitter data that predicts individual level future suicidal risk based on online social media data prior to any mention of suicidal thought.
